## 👋 Hey, I'm Codeo

Welcome to my digital workshop. I’m a developer who builds clean, scalable, and purpose-driven code — one commit at a time.

- 🛠️ Develop full-stack web apps (Vue.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Vite)
- 🎧 Integrate multimedia platforms (YouTube, Spotify API, Live Chat Players)

### 💡 Philosophy

> "Build for users, design for change, code like it matters."

I care about details. Every line of code is a design decision.  
I focus on **developer experience**, **efficiency**, and **defensive coding**.
